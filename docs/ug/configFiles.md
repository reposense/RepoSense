Given below are the details of the various config files used by RepoSense.
</div>

<box type="info" seamless>

**RepoSense ignores the first row (i.e., column headings) of CSV config files.** It is used simply to provide more information to human readers. This also means the ==columns in your config files should be in the exact order specified here==.
</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

**A value in a config file is optional to provide unless it specified as {{ mandatory }}**.
</box>
<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## `repo-config.csv`

**`repo-config.csv` file contains repo-level config data.** Each row represents a repository's configuration ([example](repo-config.csv)).


Column Name | Explanation
----------- | -----------
Repository's Location {{ mandatory }}| The `GitHub URL` or `Disk Path` to the git repository e.g., `https://github.com/foo/bar.git` or `C:\Users\user\Desktop\GitHub\foo\bar`
Branch | The branch to analyze in the target repository e.g., `master`. Default: the default branch of the repo
File formats<sup>*+</sup> | The file extensions to analyze. Default: all file formats
Ignore Glob List<sup>*+</sup> | The list of file path globs to ignore during analysis for each author. e.g., `test/**;temp/**`
Ignore standalone config | To ignore the standalone config file (if any) in target repository, enter **`yes`**. If the cell is empty, the standalone config file in the repo (if any) will take precedence over configurations provided in the csv files.
Ignore Commit List<sup>*+</sup> | The list of commits to ignore during analysis. For accurate results, the commits should be provided with their full hash. Additionally, a range of commits can be specified using the `..` notation e.g. `abc123..def456` (both inclusive).
Ignore Authors List<sup>*+</sup> | The list of authors to ignore during analysis. Authors should be specified by their [Git Author Name](#a-note-about-git-author-name).

<sup>* **Multi-value column**: multiple values can be entered in this column using a semicolon `;` as the separator.</sup>
<sup>+ **Overrideable column**: prepend with `override:` to use entered value(s) instead of value(s) from standalone config.</sup>

<box type="info" seamless>

When using [standalone config](#config-json-standalone-config-file) (if it is not ignored), it is possible to override specific values from the standalone config by prepending the entered value with `override:`.
</box>

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## `author-config.csv`

Optionally, you can use a `author-config.csv` (which should be in the same directory as `repo-config.csv` file) to provide more details about the authors to analyze ([example](author-config.csv)). It should contain the following columns:

Column Name | Explanation
----------- | -----------
Repository's Location | Same as `repo-config.csv`. Default: all the repos in `repo-config.csv`
Branch | The branch to analyze for this author e.g., `master`. Default: the author will be bound to all the repos in `repo-config.csv` that has the same repo's location, irregardless of branch
Author's GitHub ID {{ mandatory }}| GitHub username of the target author e.g., `JohnDoe`
Author's Emails<sup>*</sup> | Associated Github emails of the author. This can be found in your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
Author's Display Name | The name to display for the author. Default: author's GitHub username.
Author's Git Author Name<sup>*</sup> | The meaning of _Git Author Name_ is explained in [_A note about git author name_](#a-note-about-git-author-name).
Ignore Glob List<sup>*</sup> | Files to ignore for this author, in addition to files ignored by the patterns specified in `repo-config.csv`

<sup>* **Multi-value column**: multiple values can be entered in this column using a semicolon `;` as the separator.</sup>

If `author-config.csv` is not given and the repo has not provide author details in a standalone config file, all the authors of the repositories within the date range specified (if any) will be analyzed.

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## `group-config.csv`

Optionally, you can provide a `group-config.csv`(which should be in the same directory as `repo-config.csv` file) to provide details on any custom groupings for files in specified repositories ([example](group-config.csv)). It should contain the following columns:

Column Name | Explanation
----------- | -----------
Repository's Location | Same as `repo-config.csv`. Default: all the repos in `repo-config.csv`
Group Name {{ mandatory }}| Name of the group e.g.,`test`.
Globs * {{ mandatory }}| The list of file path globs to include for specified group. e.g.,`**/test/*;**.java`.

<sup>* **Multi-value column**: multiple values can be entered in this column using a semicolon `;` as the separator.</sup>

Note that a file in a given repository should only be tagged to one group. <br>
e.g.: `example.java` in `example-repo` can either be in `test` group or in `code` group, but not in both `test` and `code` group. If multiple groups are specified for a given file, the latter group (i.e.: `code` group) is set for the file.

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## `report-config.json`

You can optionally use `report-config.json` to customize report generation by providing the following information . ([example](report-config.csv))

**Fields to provide**:
* `title`: Title of the generated report, which is also the title of the deployed dashboard. Default: "RepoSense Report"

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

<div id="section-standalone">

## `config.json` (standalone config file)

Repo owners can provide the following additional information to RepoSense using a config file that we call the **_standalone config file_**:
* which files/authors/commits to analyze/omit
* which git and GitHub usernames belong to which authors
* the display of an author

To use this feature, add a `_reposense/config.json` to the root of your repo using the format in the example below ([another example](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/blob/master/_reposense/config.json)) and **commit it** (reason: RepoSense can see committed code only):
```json {.no-line-numbers}
{
  "ignoreGlobList": ["about-us/**", "**index.html"],
  "formats": ["html", "css"],
  "ignoreCommitList": ["90018e49f129ce7e0abdc8b18e91c9813588c601", "67890def", "abc123..def456"],
  "ignoreAuthorList": ["charlie"],
  "authors":
  [
    {
      "githubId": "alice",
      "emails": ["alice@example.com", "alicet@example.com"],
      "displayName": "Alice T.",
      "authorNames": ["AT", "A"],
      "ignoreGlobList": ["**.css"]
    },
    {
      "githubId": "bob"
    }
  ]
}
```
Note: all fields are optional unless specified otherwise.

**Fields to provide _repository-level_ info**:

* `ignoreGlobList`: Folders/files to ignore, specified using the [_glob format_](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/essential/io/fileOps.html#glob).
* `formats`: File formats to analyze. Default: all file formats
* `ignoreCommitList`: The list of commits to ignore during analysis. For accurate results, the commits should be provided with their full hash. Additionally, a range of commits can be specified using the `..` notation e.g. `abc123..def456` (both inclusive).
* `ignoreAuthorList`: The list of authors to ignore during analysis. Authors specified in `authors` field or `author-config.csv` will be also be omitted if they are in this list. Authors should be specified by their [Git Author Name](#a-note-about-git-author-name).

**Fields to provide _author-level_ info**:<br>
Note: `authors` field should contain _all_ authors that should be captured in the analysis.
* `githubId`: GitHub username of the author. {{ mandatory }} field.
* `emails`: Associated GitHub emails of the author. This can be found in your [GitHub settings](https://github.com/settings/emails).
* `displayName`: Name to display on the report for this author.
* `authorNames`: Git Author Name(s) used in the author's commits. By default RepoSense assumes an author would use her GitHub username as the Git username too. The meaning of _Git Author Name_ is explained in [_A note about git author name_](#a-note-about-git-author-name).
* `ignoreGlobList`: _Additional_ (i.e. on top of the repo-level `ignoreGlobList`) folders/files to ignore for a specific author . In the example above, the actual `ignoreGlobList` for `alice` would be `["about-us/**", "**index.html", "**.css"]`

To verify your standalone configuration is as intended, add the `_reposense/config.json` to your local copy of repo and run RepoSense against it as follows:<br>
* Format : `java -jar RepoSense.jar --repo LOCAL_REPO_LOCATION` <br>
* Example: `java -jar RepoSense.jar --repo c:/myRepose/foo/bar`<br>
After that, view the report to see if the configuration you specified in the config file is being reflected correctly in the report.

## A note about git author name

`Git Author Name` refers to the customizable author's display name set in the local `.gitconfig` file. For example, in the Git Log's display:
``` {.no-line-numbers}
...
commit cd7f610e0becbdf331d5231887d8010a689f87c7
Author: ConfiguredAuthorName <author@example.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 9 19:14:41 2018 +0800

    Make some changes to show my new author's name

commit e3f699fd4ef128eebce98d5b4e5b3bb06a512f49
Author: ActualGitHubId <author@example.com>
Date:   Fri Feb 9 19:13:13 2018 +0800

    Initial commit
 ...
```
`ActualGitHubId` and `ConfiguredAuthorName` are both `Git Author Name` of the same author.<br>
To find the author name that you are currently using for your current git repository, run the following command within your git repository:
``` {.no-line-numbers}
git config user.name
```
To set the author name to the value you want (e.g., to set it to your GitHub username) for your current git repository, you can use the following command ([more info](https://www.git-tower.com/learn/git/faq/change-author-name-email)):
``` {.no-line-numbers}
git config user.name "YOUR_AUTHOR_NAME”
```
To set the author name to use a default value you want for future git repositories, you can use the following command:
``` {.no-line-numbers}
git config --global user.name "YOUR_AUTHOR_NAME”
```
RepoSense expects the Git Author Name to be the same as author's GitHub username. If an author's `Git Author Name` is different from her `GitHub ID`, the `Git Author Name` needs to be specified in the standalone config file. If the author has more than one `Git Author Name`, multiple values can be entered too.

<box type="warning" seamless>

Note: Symbols such as `"`, `!`, `/` etc. in your author name will be omitted, which may reduce the accuracy of the analysis if 2 names in the repository are approximately similar.
