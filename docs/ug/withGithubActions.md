You can use [_GitHub Actions_](https://github.com/features/actions) (together with other GitHub tools) to automate the generating and publishing of RepoSense reports.
</div>

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## Setting up

<include src="withTravis.md#section-fork-token" />

{{ step(2)}} **Activate GitHub Actions on the forked repository:**

1. Go to the `Actions` page of your fork of the [publish-RepoSense](https://github.com/reposense/publish-RepoSense) repo.
1. Click on the green button that says `I understand my workflows, go ahead and enable them` to enable GitHub Actions on your new repository.

{{ step(3)}} **Update report configuration:**

<include src="withTravis.md#section-edit-configs" />

{{ step(4)}} **View the generated report:**

To access your regenerated RepoSense report, go to the settings of your fork in GitHub, under **GitHub Pages** section, look for `Your site is published at [LINK]`. It should look something like `https://[YOUR_GITHUB_ID].github.io/publish-RepoSense`.

There is also a published GitHub Action ([reposense-action](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/reposense-action)) that can be used to generate and publish RepoSense reports. It is especially convenient for users who wish to skip the forking and setting up of a separate repository. For more information, refer to the [usage description](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/reposense-action#usage).

## Updating the report

**Manual:**
* You can trigger GitHub to re-generate and re-deploy the report by pushing an empty commit to your fork.
* Currently, the GitHub Actions UI does not support the manual execution of workflows.

**Automated:** GitHub actions can be set to run periodically.
1. Edit the `.github/workflows/main.yml` and uncomment the `schedule:` section.
1. You may change the expression after `cron:` to a schedule of your choice. Read more about cron syntax [here](https://help.github.com/en/actions/reference/events-that-trigger-workflows#scheduled-events-schedule).
1. Commit your changes.
