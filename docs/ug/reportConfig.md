RepoSense allows you to easily showcase your coding portfolio by generating visualization reports of your contributions across different repositories.
This guide will help you set up your first RepoSense report using the `report-config.yaml` file.

## What is `report-config.yaml`?

The `report-config.yaml` file is a simple configuration file that lets you define which repositories you want to include in your RepoSense report in more detail compared to the CLI flags.
It's designed to be user-friendly, especially for beginners who want to quickly set up a code portfolio without dealing with complex configurations.

For more sophisticated use cases that require additional flexibility,
RepoSense's [CSV configuration files](./customizingReports.html#customize-using-csv-config-files) offer an alternative configuration approach with expanded capabilities.

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Create a `report-config.yaml` file

Create a new file named `report-config.yaml` in your project directory with the following basic structure:

```yaml
title: "Your Portfolio Title"
repos:
  - repo: "https://github.com/repo/yourrepo.git"
    branches:
      - branch: main
        blurb: "Short description of this project"
        authors:
          - author-git-host-id: Your username on GitHub, GitLab or Bitbucket
            author-display-name: Your display name
            author-git-author-name: Author Name Of Your Git Configuration
            author-emails:
              - emails-of-your-commits@email.com
              - emails-of-your-git-configuration@email.com
```

<box type="info" seamless>

The `author-display-name`, `author-git-author-name` and `author-emails` fields are optional.

However, users are encouraged to add their Git author name `author-git-author-name` and emails `author-emails` in their Git configuration related to their commits so that
the commits can be successfully captured.
</box>

### Step 2: Add your repositories

You can add multiple repositories to showcase different projects. Here's an example:

```yaml
title: "John Doe's Code Portfolio"
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/john/ip.git
    branches:
      - branch: master
        blurb: "Individual Project - Task Manager Application"
        authors:
          - author-git-host-id: johnDoe
            author-display-name: John Doe

  - repo: https://github.com/john/tp.git
    branches:
      - branch: master
        blurb: "Team Project - Event Management System"
        authors:
          - author-git-host-id: johnDoe
            author-display-name: John Doe
```

### Step 3: Generate your report

To run RepoSense with `report-config.yaml`:

1. Create a `config` folder in the same directory as the RepoSense.jar file.
2. Add your `report-config.yaml` to the `config` folder.
3. Run the command:`java -jar RepoSense.jar`

<box type="warning" seamless>

Please note that the above command will only analyse your commits one month before the current date. If you would like to
specify the period for report generation, you can use the `--since` and `--until` flags.

`java -jar RepoSense.jar --since START_DATE --until END_DATE`

{{ embed("Appendix: **CLI syntax reference → `since` flag**", "cli.md#section-since-date") }}
{{ embed("Appendix: **CLI syntax reference → `until` flag**", "cli.md#section-until-date") }}

</box>

<box type="info" seamless>

Additionally, you can add a `--portfolio` flag to generate a more optimized view of your report.
</box>

That's it! RepoSense will analyze the repositories you specified and generate a report that visualizes your contributions.

## Example Configuration

Here's a sample `report-config.yaml` file for a student showcasing their work across several projects:

```yaml
title: My Code Portfolio
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/RepoSense/reposense.git
    groups:
      - group-name: code
        globs:
          - "**.java"
    branches:
      - branch: master
        blurb: "Reposense is a code contribution analysis tool which I contributed."
        authors:
          - author-git-host-id: lyuanww
            author-display-name: Li Yuan
            author-emails:
              - user@gmail.com
              - e0123456@u.nus.edu
  - repo: https://github.com/lyuanww/ip.git
    groups:
      - group-name: code
        globs:
          - "**.java"
    branches:
      - branch: master
        blurb: "A task manager chat bot implemented in Java."
        authors:
          - author-git-host-id: lyuanww
            author-display-name: Li Yuan
            author-emails:
              - user@gmail.com
              - e0123456@u.nus.edu
  - repo: https://github.com/lyuanww/tp.git
    groups:
      - group-name: code
        globs:
          - "**.java"
    branches:
      - branch: master
        blurb: "A patient management system implemented in Java."
        authors:
          - author-git-host-id: lyuanww
            author-display-name: Li Yuan
            author-emails:
              - user@gmail.com
              - e0123456@u.nus.edu
```
### Sample report generated

## Further Customizing Your Report

Optionally, you can provide more detailed descriptions to your report such as an introduction at the top of your dashboard or explanatory blurbs for each repository. Please refer to this [section](./customizingReports.md#personalizing-reports).

## Advanced Report Configuration

For users who need more advanced configuration options, `report-config.yaml` offers many additional features beyond the basic setup. The following section explains the complete syntax and capabilities.

* `title`: Sets the title of your generated report, which appears as the title of the deployed dashboard.
    * Default: "RepoSense Report".
* `repos`: A list of repositories to include in your analysis..
    * This field is an array, so you can include multiple repositories.

#### Repository-Level Fields

For each repository in the `repos` list, you can specify:

* `repo` {{ mandatory }} : The URL to the repository you want to analyze.
  * Example: `https://github.com/RepoSense/reposense.git`
