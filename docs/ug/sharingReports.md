**Often, you would want to share the RepoSense report with others.** For example, a teacher using RepoSense for a programming class might want to share the report privately with tutors or publish it so that everyone can see it.
</div>

The sections below explains various ways of sharing a RepoSense report.

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

### Share privately

To share a RepoSense report privately, simply find a way to share the folder containing the report (by default, it will be in a folder named `reposense-report`). For example, you can zip that folder and share it with the intended recipients.

You can point the recipients to the [_**Using reports**_](usingReports.html) section for guidance on how to view reports.

### Publish on the web

As RepoSense reports are in a web page format, you can publish a report by simply uploading it onto any web hosting service. Given below are several options that not only allow to publish reports, but **also enable various levels of automating** the entire process (e.g., automatically update the report daily).
