Let's look at different ways to generate RepoSense reports.
</div>

* **If you have Java in your computer**, the straight-forward way to generate a report is to use the RepoSense executable to generate the report locally in your computer, as explained in the [_Generating reports locally_](#generating-reports-locally) section below.

* **If you don't have Java on your computer or do not wish to run the executable in your computer**, some alternatives are provided in the [_Generating reports remotely_](#generating-reports-remotely) section below.

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## Generating reports locally

1. **Ensure you have the prerequisites**:
   * **Java 8** (JRE `1.8.0_60`) or later ([download :fas-download:](https://www.java.com/en/)).
   * **git `2.14`** or later on the command line. ([download :fas-download:](https://git-scm.com/downloads)).<br> run `git --version` in your OS terminal to confirm the version.

1. **Download the latest JAR file** from our [releases](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/releases/latest).

1. **Generate a report**: The simplest use case for RepoSense is to generate a report for the recent history of a repo.<br>
  command: `java -jar RepoSense.jar --repos LIST_OF_REPO_URLS --view`<br>
  Examples:
   * `java -jar RepoSense.jar --repos https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense.git --view` (note the `.git` at the end of the repo URL)
   * `java -jar RepoSense.jar --repos https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense.git c:/myRepose/foo/bar --view` analyzes the two specified repos (one remote, one local).

   The above commands will analyze the given repo(s) for commits done within ==the last month== and open the report in your default Browser.

**To learn how to generate a report using <tooltip content="e.g., generate a report for a different period, for specific file types, for specific authors, etc.">other settings</tooltip>**, head over to the [_**Customizing reports**_](customizingReports.html) section.

## Generating reports remotely

**You can generate a RepoSense report remotely without installing/running anything on your computer.** This is particularly useful when you are deciding whether to adopt RepoSense.

**The easiest option is to use Netlify.** The instructions are given below.

**You can also use the following options.** While they are more work to set up, they are more suitable as a permanent solution due to their generous free tier.
