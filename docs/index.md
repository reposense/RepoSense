<span id="overview">

**RepoSense can generate interactive visualizations of programmer activities, even across multiple repositories.** It's ideal for educators and managers to get insights on programming activities of their mentees. The visualizations can be **easily shared** with others (e.g., as an online dashboard) and updating of the visualizations periodically **can be automated**.

{% macro heading(icon, text) %}<h4>{{ thumbnail(icon) }} <span class="lead font-weight-bold text-green">{{ text }}</span></h4>{% endmacro %}

Some example insights RepoSense can provide:


{{ heading(":fas-code:", "Insights about the code") }}

* Which part of the code was written by Tom? How many lines? How many files?
* Which test cases were written by Kim?
* Which commit messages were written by Serene?

{{ heading(":fas-chart-pie:", "Insights about the type of work") }}

* Which portion of Jacob's code is documentation?
* Who hasn't written any test code yet?
* Which project did Jolene contribute to in the last month?

{{ heading(":fas-business-time:", "Insights about the timing of work") }}

* Who is putting in the consistent effort?
* Who waits till the deadline to do the work?
* Who hasn't started any work yet?

{{ heading(":fas-list-ol:", "Insights based on comparisons") }}

* Which programmers/teams are falling behind?
* How does everyone compare in their front-end coding work over the past two weeks?
* Who are the the top 10 code contributors?
