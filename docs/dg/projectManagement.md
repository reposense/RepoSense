## Deploying the production website

We have two versions of the website:

1. **Production website** at https://reposense.org
   * matches the latest released version
   * deployed manually after each new release
1. **Dev website** at https://reposense.org/RepoSense
   * matches the latest `master` branch
   * deployed automatically by Travis whenever the `master` branch is updated

The production website differs from the dev website in some ways e.g.,

* It has a `CNAME` file (to indicate that it is the target destination for the `reposense.org` domain name)
* Its DG pages show a warning that it is not the latest version of the DG.

These variations are mainly managed by MarkBind via the `site.config` file. That is why the `site.config` file in the `release` branch is slightly different from the one in the `master` branch.

After each release, do the following steps to deploy the production website:
1. Switch to the `release` branch
1. `cd docs`
1. `markbind build`
1. `markbind deploy`
1. After a few minutes, check https://markbind.org to ensure it has been updated as intended.
