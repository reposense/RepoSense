Our workflow is mostly based on the guidelines given at se-education.org/guides.
</div>

**To submit a PR**, follow [this guide](https://se-education.org/guides/guidelines/PRs.html), but note the following:

* As we squash the commits when merging a PR, there is ==no need to follow a strict commit organization or write elaborate commit messages for each commit==.<br>
  However, when pushing new commits to your PR branch, do clean up _new_ commits (i.e., commits not yet pushed) e.g., delete temporary print statements added for debugging purposes.
* In the PR description, please propose a commit message to be used when the PR is merged eventually. The commit message should follow the guidelines given [here](https://se-education.org/guides/guidelines/PRs.html). You may refer to [this PR](https://github.com/reposense/RepoSense/pull/1057) for an example.
* You can refer to the [Architecture](architecture.html) and the [HTML Report](report.html) sections to learn about the design and implementation of RepoSense. 
* The section below has more information about the various stages of submitting a PR.

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## Following the code style

* Make sure you know our coding standards.
  {{ embed('Appendix: Coding Standards', 'styleGuides.md', level=2) }}
* **Follow [this](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijCodeStyle.html) to configure Intellij to follow our coding style**.
* **This project uses Checkstyle** to check the compliance of Java code. You can use [this document](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/checkstyle.html) to find how to use it.
* **To check Pug files for style errors**, run `npm run lint` from the project root directory. You can use the `npm run lintfix` to automatically fix some of the javascript and css lint errors.

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## Running the app from code

<div id="section-running-from-code">

* To run the app from code, run `gradlew run` from the project root. By default, it will run based on the config files in the `[project root]/config` folder.
* To supply flags, you can use the `-Dargs="[FLAGS]"` format.<br>
  e.g., `gradlew run -Dargs="--since 31/12/2019 --formats java adoc xml"`
</div>

<!-- ==================================================================================================== -->

## Debugging (front-end)

**You can use Vue.js devtools for frontend debugging on Chrome.** Here are the steps:
1. On your Chrome, visit the website of [Vue.js devtools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vuejs-devtools/nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd) and add the extension.
1. Go the detail page of this extension in Chrome's extension management panel and select `Allow access to file URLs`. If you are unable to locate it, copy the link: `chrome://extensions/?id=nhdogjmejiglipccpnnnanhbledajbpd` and visit it on your Chrome.
1. Open any report generated by RepoSense.
1. Press `F12` or right click and choose `inspect` at the report page.
1. Choose `Vue` at the navigation bar.<br>

1. Debug using the tool.<br>

## Testing (front-end)

**We use [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for automated end-to-end front-end testing.**

### Writing tests
1. Create a new test file in `frontend/cypress/tests`.
1. At project root start *Cypress Test Runner* by running `gradlew cypress`.
1. On the top right hand corner, set `Chrome` as the default browser.
1. Under **Integration Tests**, click on the newly created test file to run it.

<box type="info" seamless>

Read [Cypress's Documentation](https://docs.cypress.io/api/commands/document.html#Syntax) to familiarize yourself with its syntax and [Cypress's debugging guide](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging.html#Log-Cypress-events) to tackle problems with your tests.
</box>

<box type="warning" seamless>

Note that it is **compulsory** to add tests for the new front-end changes that you made to prevent regression bugs, except for trivial changes that are unlikely to cause any regression or other situations where testing does not apply to the change.
</box>

<!-- ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ -->

### Running tests

To run all tests locally, run `gradlew frontendTest`.

<box type="info" seamless>

If you encountered an invalid browser error, ensure that you have `Chrome` installed in the default installation directory. Otherwise, follow the instructions [here](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/guides/debugging.html#Launching-browsers) to create symbolic links so Cypress can locate `Chrome` in your system.
</box>

## Writing documentation

**This project uses [MarkBind](https://markbind.org/)** for documentation. Follow [this tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/markbind.html) to learn how to use MarkBind for updating project documentation.

**To show some content only in the <tooltip content="i.e., https://reposense.org">production website</tooltip>**, add the `tags="production"` attribute to the HTML element enclosing the content. Similarly, `tags="dev"` will make the content appear only in the <tooltip content="i.e., https://reposense.org/RepoSense">dev website</tooltip>.

```html
<span tags="production">This will appear in the production website only.</span>
<span tags="dev">This will appear in the dev website only.</span>
This will appear in both sites.
```
