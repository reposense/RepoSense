1. **clone** the fork to your computer.

## Setting up the IDE

<box type="warning" seamless>

The recommended IDE is **Intellij IDEA**. While it is not compulsory to use it, note that we will not be able to help you troubleshoot IDE problems if you use any other IDE.
</box>

1. **Ensure you have configured IDEA for the correct JDK**, as explained in [this tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijJdk.html).
1. **Import the project as a Gradle project**, as explained in [this tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/intellijImportGradleProject.html).

## Verifying the setup

<box type="info" seamless>

This project is already configured to use Gradle for build automation. If you are new to Gradle, see [this tutorial](https://se-education.org/guides/tutorials/gradle.html) to learn how to use it.
</box>

1. Open a command prompt and navigate to the project root.
1. Run `gradlew clean build` (`./gradlew clean build` if you on a Unix-like OS), and ensure that it finishes with a `BUILD SUCCESSFUL` message.
1. Run the tests using the `gradlew test systemtest` command and ensure it succeeds too.
1. You can also try running the app using code, as given in the panel below.
